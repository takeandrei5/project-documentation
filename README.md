####Branches
In this project we follow the feature branch strategy - every feature that we work on has to be on separate branch.
The branch format is the following:
```
feature/<your-initials>/<ticket-id>-<short-description-split-with-hypens>
e.g. for Paul George and ticket number 1234: feature/pg/1234-add-login-form
```
